First off - thank you!

There are a few small ground rules to contributing to graim:
 - format your code with Prettier - if it makes a stupid formatting decision, feel free to add an exception to it
 - use TypeScript, not JavaScript
 - make sure your contributions do not needlessly complicate other parts of the bot
