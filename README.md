## Configure/Install
Check out the [configuration guide](./setup.md).

## TODOs

## Features
- moderation syncs across rooms

- Automatically attribute moderation history to graimdb
- Discord moderators may use `whosent` to discover what matrix user is behind a Discord message
- Userinfo command
- Database management commands (add/remove user, add/remove moderator)


## How
graim is built with the intention of being Matrix-first. There are a few reasons for this:
- Discord API sucks
- Discord webhooks have incredibly little data attributed to them
- I <3 Matrix

Every Discord user, via matrix-appservice-discord, is given its own user (i.e. `@_discord_<discord_id>:matrix.org`. So, graim listens for commands only from Matrix users - because Discord users are Matrix users by proxy.
Simply tie a server to a group of rooms, then tie each Matrix user to a Discord account packaged in one "graim user" :D
